DOMAIN : EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

DURATION :  FEBRUARY 5th, 2025 to MARCH 5th, 2025 (4 WEEKS)

MENTOR : NEELA SANTHOSH

OVERVIEW : HOME-AUTOMATION-WITH-BLUETOOTH

### **Objectives:**
 Control two relays and LEDs using Bluetooth/Serial commands via an Arduino UNO. Enable remote switching of electrical appliances using simple command-based operations. To design a bluetooth-controoled home automation system using Arduino
 

### **Key Elements:**
1. Relays (2x): Used to control external devices.
2. LEDs (2x): Indicate the ON/OFF status of relays.
3. Serial Communication: Receives commands ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D') for relay and LED control.
4. Arduino UNO: Processes commands and controls the relays and LEDs.
5. User Commands:

'A' → Turn ON Relay 1 & LED 1
'B' → Turn OFF Relay 1 & LED 1
'C' → Turn ON Relay 2 & LED 2
'D' → Turn OFF Relay 2 & LED 2


### **Technology Used:**
1. Arduino UNO (Microcontroller for processing commands)
2. C++ (Arduino IDE) Programming for control logic
3. Serial Communication (9600 baud rate) for receiving commands
4. Relay Modules for switching external devices
5. Bluetooth Module (HC-05) for wireless control.

**Application:** Useful for home automation, IoT-based control, and remote device operation.
